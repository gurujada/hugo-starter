            <p>Hey there, I am Virinchi a front end developer, inventor and an Astronomy Enthusiast. I love staying up
              late into the night gazing at stars through my telescope and making homemade inventions to substitute
              store-bought ones. Till now, I have successfully managed to view the Orion Nebula, a few stars such as
              Sirius and take a close up shot of the moon. I have also been selected for the National Level Inspire
              Awards which I got as an encouraging gesture to help me innovate new, better things.
              I also like ancient Sanskrit poetry that is excruciatingly hard to pronounce and tediously long.
              My passion for computer programming has led me to explore Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and
              Web Development. With my learnings, I aspire to build amazing products that make the world a better place
              to live.</p>
