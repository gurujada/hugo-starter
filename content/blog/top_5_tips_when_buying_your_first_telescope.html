                <p>A telescope can make a great gift to your loved ones. If they use it carefully, it
                  can last them a lifetime. It can open a portal to the universe and provide a lifetime of enjoyment.
                  However, just as there is no perfect car, there is no 'perfect telescope'. Instead, one should choose
                  based on his/her interests. So here's a complete guide into the uncharted world of Telescopes. </p>
                <h2 class="text-center heading">Types of Telescopes</h2>
                <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-xl-8 col-md-8">
                    <p class="text-white-50">Refractors:- These are what most of us stereotype as a telescope-- a long
                      skinny tube with a lens at one end and an eyepiece at the other (just like the one Gallelio used).
                      They are lovely telescopes and are superior performers in inferior conditions. However, they are
                      expensive and not recommended for beginners. They also encounter something called chromatic
                      aberration meaning that one will see coloured rings around stars. </p>
                    <p class="text-white-50">Reflectors:- These telescopes are great for beginners and they use mirrors
                      to collect and reflect the light. They are great for beginners in the sense that they have larger
                      mirrors which enables them to have better light collecting capacity. These telescopes do not have
                      chromatic aberration and are relatively low cost. However, these telescopes have open mirrors
                      which will expose them to dust and humidity. Despite the cons, I would recommend these to any
                      beginner for their ease of use and their unbreakablness. </p>
                    <p class="text-white-50">Compound:- These telescopes use a combination of mirrors and lenses to
                      collect the light and tend to be more expensive and are not recommended for beginners. </p>

                  <h3>Here are a few tips that one should consider when buying a first telescope</h3>
                  <h5 class="mt-3">Tastes:-</h5>
                  <p> Firstly, one has to choose a telescope depending on
                    his/her tastes. If one is planning to pursue
                    the hobby seriously, I would suggest that he/she get a good quality and expensive telescope with
                    which
                    one can observe other galaxies. But, if one is thinking of just looking at NEOs(Near Earth Objects)
                    or the moon with it, I would suggest that he/she go for the low-end ones.</p>

                  <h5>Aperture:-</h5>
                  <p> Whenever people are looking to buy their first
                    telescope, I have often heard them say, "Give me the one with the highest magnification". But in
                    contrast, they should be looking for the one with a larger tube-diameter (aperture). Generally, a
                    telescope's aperture is measured in inches or millimetres. As a practice, try to choose a telescope
                    that has an aperture greater than 2.8 inches(70mm). A larger aperture can collect more light. This
                    is a boon for people living in cities as it lets them see more detail in faint objects. For example,
                    an 80mm aperture would suffice to observe the Milky way from dark places. Yet, one would require an
                    aperture of 6-8 inches to see those same things from a sub-urban area. Regardless of your skies, a
                    larger aperture lets you see more clearly than a smaller scope.</p>

                  <h5>Focal Length:-</h5>
                  <p>A telescope's magnification power partly
                    depends on the Focal length of the telescope. The larger the focal length -- the larger the
                    magnification and the smaller the field of view. I do not recommend large focal lengthed telescopes
                    to beginners as it makes it harder to locate the target they're looking for with a small field of
                    view. A telescope's focal length is written on its frame and for an eyepiece, it's labelled on its
                    side. To calculate the magnification of a telescope, one has to <b>divide the focal length of
                      the
                      telescope by the focal length of the eyepiece magnification.</b></p>

                  <h3 class="mt-5">Mounts/Stands</h3>
                  <p>A telescope's mount is one of the most important pieces
                    of gear in your arsenal. Without a
                    stable mount, it doesn't matter how good your telescope is since all the images will appear wobbly.
                  </p>

                  <h5>Manual Mounts:-</h5>
                  <p>These mounts require you to manually adjust
                    levers and turn spindles to move the telescope. They would help a beginner but remember to get a
                    good and stable one. They require no prerequisites and can be practically set up anywhere.</p>

                  <h5>Equatorial mounts:-</h5>
                  <p>These mounts are bulky, weird-looking, require to be pointed towards the North star and
                    take a long time to set up. However, they allow smooth moving to track the night sky. It is
                    difficult to operate and not at all recommended for a first timer especially if he/she has
                    kids.</p>

                  <h5>Computerised mounts (Go To mounts):-</h5>
                  <p> These mounts have a remote which can be used to control and move the telescope. They have
                    their GPS module and do not require any alignment. These mounts got their name from a button on the
                    remote which says 'GO TO'. Selecting a target and pressing this button would point the telescope
                    towards the desired target. As all good things do, they come with a couple of drawbacks. Firstly,
                    they are expensive and a few models are bulky. Secondly, these mounts require a power source which
                    might be a problem if you are in the middle of a desert (You can hook it up to your car battery
                    though) They make a perfect choice for people living in cities because manually pointing the
                    telescope at an object in the sky is difficult in intense light pollution.</p>


                  <h3 class="mt-5">A few other essential tips to keep in mind </h3>
                  <h5>Eyepieces:-</h5>
                  <p>All telescopes come with eyepieces. However, for
                    telescopes, it is the eyepieces that magnify an object. Just when you think you've used your
                    telescope to its fullest potential, think again. Upgrade the eyepiece and you'll be blown by the
                    change. An eyepiece increases the focal ratio of your scope thereby affecting the magnification.
                    Generally, eyepieces are bought in sets-- The Meade's Super Plössl is a perfect collection for a
                    beginner. The good thing about them is that they are interchangeable between telescopes. So buying
                    an exceptionally good eyepiece enables you to use it with multiple telescopes. Eyepieces are
                    counter-intuitive. The lower the number on their label, the higher they magnify. Having an excellent
                    eyepiece is more important than having an excellent telescope.</p>

                  <h5 class="mt-5">Barlow Lens:-</h5>
                  <p>The Barlow lens comes in between the eyepiece
                    and the telescope. It increases the focal length. Essentially doubling the magnification of any
                    lens. Barlow lens comes in 2x, 3x, 5x etc.</p>


                  <h3 class="mt-5"> You get what you pay for</h3>
                  <p> A standard way to tell which telescope is of good quality is by the price.
                    Good telescopes cost
                    around
                    $200-$400. If you have bought a telescope at some random thrift shop for around $50-$100, return it
                    immediately! It can't be of good quality and a telescope with which you are frustrated won't do you
                    much good. </p>

                  <h3 class="mt-5"> Choose wisely</h3>
                  <p> I have seen a lot of people who end up buying very expensive telescopes and
                    honestly don't know anything much about them. If you are buying something which you and your family
                    will use, choose wisely. A good quality telescope if maintained well can last you a lifetime. Once
                    you
                    have bought your first telescope, your tastes improve and after a few years, you can upgrade to
                    bigger
                    and better ones.</p>

                  <h3 class="mt-5"> A word of Caution</h3>
                  <p> Be wary of telescopes that are advised by their magnification rather than
                    their aperture. Typically, a telescope's maximum useful magnification is 50 times its aperture in
                    inches (or twice its aperture in millimetres). So you'd need a 6-inch-wide scope to get a decent
                    image
